				About The Game
			</div>
			<div class="box pad curve">
				<ul>
						<li>&bull; Almost an exact copy of the nostalgic Balls built into old Windows systems back in the 90s. Many people will probably remember the working days of the time when the first super-fast IBM-s appeared at work! For hours on end, workers sat at newfangled computers playing games, and the most famous and popular game at that time was Lines or, as many people called it, Balls.</li>
						<li>&bull; What was good about the built-in Lines 98(Lines 98), and the fact that it worked equally well on any computer with an operating system from Microsoft. Lines practically do not need computer resources - the game is simple and ingenious. For those who missed the beginning of the computer era, here are the rules of the game.</li>
						<li>&bull; Balls of different colors appear on the playing field. The player must arrange them in such a way that horizontally, diagonally or vertically chains of five or more identical balls are formed. This one-color group disappears from the field. Keep in mind that the ball will not be able to pass to the selected position if the path there is blocked by others.</li>
						<li>&bull; You can play the game LINES 98 online 24 hours a day for free. It is no need to download and install it on your computer, and it is also not required you to be the registered user. Just ckick and enjoy. See also a set of related games below on that you might be interested to look.</li>

				System Requirements
			</div>
			<div class="box pad curve">
				<ul>
						<li>&bull; Minimum Intel atom (or equivalent) Single-Core 1.33 Ghz Processor</li>
						<li>&bull; Minimum 512 DDR 1 - 266 Ghz RAM</li>
						<li>&bull; Direct X 9.0 C or higher</li>
						<li>&bull; Any video chipset - Integrated or dedicated graphic card</li>
						<li>&bull; Browser gaming, on the other hand, will mostly require you to have only a decent-enough internet connection. Usually, anywhere between 8-10 Mbps will be more than just fine for browser gaming, as these games are definitely not as demanding as some cloud games can be. Ideally, you should aim at having a < 30 ms ping for a smooth gaming experience.</li>
						<li>&bull; Browser games are mostly implemented by using standard web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly. Since the front end of a browser is what runs in the user’s browser, there really is no need to think about everything that’s going on in the back end.</li>
